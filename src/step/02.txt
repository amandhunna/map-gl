 /**
  * STEP 2.1: load static data i.e tile-set or shape-file data 
  * Go to https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/
  * Click on "New tileSet" button and upload an tile set (shape-file) "refer screenshot src/screenshot/tile-set.png"
  * 
  * once map is loaded add a "source" to the map, A "source" is a shape-file which can have multiple layers
  * If want to do some interactions over map then add those events to "source" (not on layer). A layer is a part of source.
  * 
  * STEP 2.2: load dynamic data i.e geojson 
  * Go to https://geojson.io/ and create some route using line geometry and copy that JSON to addSource_fromGeojson function
  * similar to step 2.1 now we need to add layer to show data over map
